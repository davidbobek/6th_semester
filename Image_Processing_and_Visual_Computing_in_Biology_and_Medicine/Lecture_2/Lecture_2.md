# Types of classification
- Binary classification
- Multi-class classification

## Multi-class classification vs Multi-label classification
- Multi-class classification: Each sample belongs to one and only one class
- Multi-label classification: Each sample can belong to multiple classes

## Segmentation
- Each pixel is classified as a class

## Is Segmentation a classification problem or a regression problem?
- It is a classification problem
- It is a regression problem
- It is clustering problem

## Steps in ML Modelling
- Define the problem
- Collect the data
- Look at the data and explore it
- Decide on the evaluation metric 
 - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
 - Regression: Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, R2 score
 - Clustering: Silhouette score
- Define Features
 - Feature Engineering 
- Split the data into training and testing: Cross-validation
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model
- Tune the model based on Hyperparameters 
- Make predictions  

## Loss functions
- Impurity/Gini Index
