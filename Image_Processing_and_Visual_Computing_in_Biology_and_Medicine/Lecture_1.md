# Biomedical Imaging
- Strucural Imaging
    - X-ray
    - CT
    - MRI
    - Ultrasound
- Functional Imaging
    - PET
    - SPECT
    - fMRI


## Microscopy
- Histopathology: Study of tissues under microscope
- Staining: Dyeing the tissues to make them visible under microscope
- Reflectance Confocal Microscopy: 
    - Uses a laser to scan the tissue and create a black and white image
    - Used in dermatology
- UltraSound Microscopy
    - Uses high frequency sound waves to create an image
    - Used in imaging of internal organs (baby in womb)
- Medical Sonography
    - Uses ultrasound to visualize subcutaneous body structures
    - Used in obstetrics
- UltraSound Localization Microscopy
    - Uses ultrasound with microscopes to visualize cells
    - Used in cancer research
- Optical Coherence Tomography
    - Uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, 3D images from within optical scattering media
    - Used in ophthalmology (retina imaging)
- ColonoScopy
    - Uses a camera to visualize the colon
    - Used in colon cancer screening
    - The most invasive of all the imaging techniques
- Xray Microscopy
    - Uses X-rays to visualize cells
    - Safe to use on living cells and tissues
    - Cant pass through thick tissues and bones
- MamoGraphy
    - Uses X-rays to visualize the breast
    - Used in breast cancer screening
- Digital Subtraction Angiography
    - Uses X-rays to visualize blood vessels
    - Used in angiography
- Computed Tomography (CT)
    - Uses X-rays to visualize the body in 3D
    - Used in cancer diagnosis
    - Rotating X-ray machine
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
    - Uses magnetic fields to visualize the body in 3D
    - CANT go with metals 
    - Hydrogen atoms are used to align the magnetic field
    - Can show much more detail than CT due to  
-  Emisson Tomography
    - Uses radioactive tracers to visualize the body in 3D
    - Used in cancer diagnosis
    - PET
        - Positron Emission Tomography
        - Combined with CT/MRI for conology imaging
        - Better quality images 
    - SPECT
        - Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography
        - Bone scans/ Heart scans
        - Lower quality images
    
- PhotoAcoustic Tomography
    - light heats up the tissue and creates sound waves
    - 3D images of the body are created
    - Used in cancer diagnosis
    - Latest Technology

## What is a PACS
- PACS
    - Picture Archiving and Communication System
    - Medical imaging technology used for storing, retrieving, presenting, and sharing images produced by various medical hardware modalities
    - Used in radiology, cardiology, pathology, and ophthalmology
