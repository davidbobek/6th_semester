# Basics of Genetics

## What is Genetics?
- Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in living organisms.

## DNA Packaging
- In nucleus, DNA is packaged into chromosomes
- Chromosomes are not visible in the cell’s nucleus—not even under a microscope—when the cell is not dividing.

## HOW DO GENETICISTS INDICATE THE LOCATION OF A GENE?
- Geneticists use maps to describe the location of a particular gene on a chromosome.
- Cytogenetic location is the gene’s location on a chromosome.
- Based on pattern of light and dark bands

## CytoGenetic Location
- Each chromosome is divided into two arms based on the location of the centromere.
- Position on "p" : short arm
- Position on "q" : long arm

- Encoding: 14q21
    - 14: Chromosome number
    - q: long arm
    - 21: position on long arm

## Molecular Location
-  A gene;s molecular address pinpoints the location of that gene in terms of nucleotides
- HUGO: Human Genome Organization -> standardize the nomenclature of genes

## How many chromosomes do humans have?
- Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes.
    - Women have two copies of the X chromosome
    - Men have one X and one Y chromosome

    - 22 Autosomes are numbered by size (1-22)
    - 23rd is either X or Y based on the gender as there are only 2
