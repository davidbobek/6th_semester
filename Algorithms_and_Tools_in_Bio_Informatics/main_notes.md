# Algorithms and tools in Bio-Informatics

## Standard Datasets and Formats
1. Fasta
- Nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence

2. FASTQ
- Nucleotide sequence and quality scores
- Same as fasta but with quality scores (Phred scores)
![alt text](imgs/image-1.png)
- Phred score: generated by DNA sequencer, measures the quality of the base call

3. SAM/BAM
- Sequence Alignment/Map
- Binary version of SAM

- Text based format to store sequence alignment data into a reference sequence
